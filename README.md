## Introduction
The Library Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It aims to streamline and enhance the management of books, patrons, and administrative tasks within a library setting.

## Features
- ✨ **User Roles and Access Management:** Implementing user roles (Patron, Librarian, and Admin) and managing access to different functionalities based on those roles.
- 📖 **CRUD Operations on Books:** Create, Read, Delete, and Update operations for managing books in the library system.
- 📋 **Issuing and Renewing Books:** Librarians can issue books to patrons (users) and renew the issued book status based on user requests.
- 📚  Rent, Book Returns, and Fine Collection: Processing book returns and collecting rents and fines from patrons.

## Technologies Used
- 🛠️ **MongoDB:** NoSQL document database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- 🚀 **Express.js:** Web application framework for building server-side applications and APIs.
- ⚛️ **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- 🔧 **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for running server-side code.
- 🔒 **Redux Toolkit:** Library for managing application state in Redux.
- 🔐 **JWT Authentication and Password Encryption:** JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization, and password encryption for enhanced security.
- 💅 **Ant Design Library:** UI library for React, providing customizable and well-designed components.
